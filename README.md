# server-client
An application for summing two numbers.
The addition operation itself must be played on a server that accepts two additions and delivers the result.
Therefore, this application contains two components: server and client.
The client component consists of two fields for entering inputs, a start button and one field for displaying the result of addition.
The client is a console application.
The server component should accept these two numbers from the client, collect them and deliver to the client their sum.
Both components were created in separate projects.
All exceptions that occur in the code (try-catch blocks) are also processed.
